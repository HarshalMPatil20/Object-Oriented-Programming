# Functional Programming (Java 8+)

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. Java 8 introduced several features that support functional programming, such as lambda expressions, streams, and method references.
This section covers the following topics:
- Lambda Expressions
- Method References
- Streams
- Optional
- Functional Interfaces

This section provides an overview of functional programming concepts in Java 8 and later versions, including lambda expressions, method references, streams, and optional types. It also discusses functional interfaces and their role in functional programming.
